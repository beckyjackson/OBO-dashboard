INFO	lowercase_definition	pain [MFOEM:000203]	IAO_0000115 [IAO:0000115]	pain is a bodily process in an organism S, involving two integrated levels:     (a) activation of the nociceptive system and associated emotion generating brain components of S, and     (b) a simultaneous aversive sensory and emotional experience on the part of S,     where (b) is phenomenologically similar to the sort of aversive experience involved in pain with concordant tissue damage.
