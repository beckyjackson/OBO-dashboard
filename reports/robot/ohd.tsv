This is useful when needing to find only the non-inferred type of an individual, and not the all the inferred types.  For example, suppose x is a member of the class 'material entity' and 'material entity' is a subclass of 'independent continuant'.  This entails that x will be a member of 'independent continuant'.  However, by using this annotation to assert that x is a member of 'material entity', you can query for x's 'asserted type' and ignore the other inferred types in the class hierarchy.
