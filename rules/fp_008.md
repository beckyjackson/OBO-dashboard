## "Documented" Automated Check

### Requirements
1. The ontology **must** have a homepage.
2. The ontology **must** have a description.

### Implementation
The registry data is checked for 'homepage' and 'description' entries. If either is missing, this is an error. If the homepage is present, the URL is checked to see if it resolves (does not return an HTTP status of greater than 400). If the URL does not resolve, this is also an error.

```python
import requests


def has_documentation(data):
   """Check fp 8 - documentation.

   If the ontology has a valid homepage and description, return PASS. The
   homepage URL must also resolve.

   Args:
       data (dict): ontology registry data from YAML file

   Return:
       PASS or ERROR with optional help message
   """
   # check if the data exists
   if 'homepage' in data:
       home = data['homepage']
   else:
       home = None
   if 'description' in data:
       descr = data['description']
   else:
       descr = None

   if home is None and descr is None:
       return 'ERROR|missing homepage and description'
   elif home is None:
       return 'ERROR|missing homepage'
   elif descr is None:
       return 'ERROR|missing description'

   # check if URL resolves
   try:
       request = requests.get(home)
   except Exception as e:
       return 'ERROR|homepage URL (%s) does not resolve' % home
   if request.status_code > 400:
       return 'ERROR|homepage URL (%s) does not resolve' % home
   return 'PASS'
```
